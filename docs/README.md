To all who come to this happy place: welcome.

This is the repo for [https://astro-imagetools-docs.vercel.app/](https://astro-imagetools-docs.vercel.app/).
This repo contains all the source code to build the docs site.

## We are Astro

We want everyone to be successful building sites, and that means helping everyone understand how Astro works.

## Raise an Issue

Is something missing?
Is something wrong?
Could something be better?
Issues are a quick way for you to offer us feedback about the docs.

Before you share, please [see if your issue has already been reported](https://github.com/RafidMuhymin/astro-imagetools/issues).

## Edit a Page

Every page on [https://astro-imagetools-docs.vercel.app/](https://astro-imagetools-docs.vercel.app/) has an **Edit this page** button in the sidebar.
You can click that button to edit the source code for that page in **GitHub**.

After you make your changes, click **Commit changes**.
This will automatically create a [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks) of the docs in your GitHub account with the changes.

Once your edits are ready in GitHub, follow the prompts to **create a pull request** and submit your changes for review.

## Develop

To begin developing locally, checkout this project from your machine.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:RafidMuhymin/astro-imagetools.git
```

You can install and run the project locally using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/). Head to [the pnpm installation guide](https://pnpm.io/installation) to get that set up. Then, run the following from your terminal:

```shell
pnpm install

pnpm dev
```

If you’re copying these instructions, remember to [configure this project as a fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork).

```shell
git remote add upstream git@github.com:RafidMuhymin/astro-imagetools.git
```

At any point, create a branch for your contribution.
We are not strict about branch names.

```shell
git checkout -b add/klingon-language
```

That’s it.
As you [open a pull request](https://github.com/withastro/astro/compare), please include a clear title and description.

```markdown
# Add Klingon language to Getting Started page

This adds the Klingon language and also updates the sidebar and language selection components.
```

Thank you for helping make the docs awesome.
